A LEMP software stack is a group of open source software that is typically installed together to enable a server to host dynamic websites and web apps. This term is actually an acronym which represents the Linux operating system, with the ENginx web server (which replaces the Apache component of a LAMP stack). The site data is stored in a MySQL database (using MariaDB), and dynamic content is processed by PHP.

Nginx is a growing open-source web server software and PHP v7 is the latest version of PHP engine. In this tutorial, we will use it to build a LEMP (Linux, ENginx, MySQL, PHP) stack server. Nginx replaces the popular Apache package found in LAMP stack.
